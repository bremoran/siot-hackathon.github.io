# Securing the IoT Hackathon

The aim of this hackathon is to bring people together who are interested to work on practical solutions to improve security in the Internet of Things (IoT).
The hackathon will consist of one day tutorial and two days of coding, coding, and coding&mdash;all garnished in a stimulating and fun atmosphere!

Specifically, we will implement running solutions of the IETF working groups [Software Updates for Internet of Things (SUIT)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/suit/about/), [Trusted Execution Environment Provisioning  (TEEP)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/teep/about/), and [Remote ATtestation ProcedureS (RATS)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/rats/about/). Parts of our efforts will be interoperability tests.
