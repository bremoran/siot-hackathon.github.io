# Call for Participation

This hackathon focuses on technologies developed in three IETF working groups (WGs), namely RATS, SUIT, and TEEP. You will find more details in the [background section](background).
Each of the three areas have their unique challenges and you will not get bored with any of the projects.


## Purpose of the SIoT Hackathon

The main purpose of IETF-related hackathons is to determine whether specifications are complete and correct, whether interoperable implementations can be written, and to learn more about the complexity or other challenges of the solutions. Unlike other hackathons, these events are not competitions. Collaboration with other developers is not only appreciated but rather expected.

You are not required to participate in any of the IETF working groups, although it helps.

## Prerequisites for the SIoT Hackathon

If you do not like programming then this hackathon is not for you. Sorry!

Note also that the tutorials on the first day are hands-on tutorials and very technical. As the name of the hackathon indicates there is a lot of security technology involved. You should be familiar with the basics of cryptography.

### Technical Knowledge

If you are not already familiar with any of the [three technological areas](background), select one of them and carefully read the relevant working group documents. Do not hesitate to reach out to the specification authors or to the working group if you have questions regarding the specifications.


### Programming Skills

This hackathon will benefit from different programming skills depending on which type of hardware you want to work on.
You should like to develop software in at least one the languages below.

**C&mdash;**
If you are planning to implement software work on end hosts then programming skills in C are required because embedded programming typically happens in C. You are also expected to read and understand code written by others because code is available from prior hackathons and from contributing companies. We will point you to the relevant code ahead of time and will discuss it during the one-day hands-on tutorial day.



**Python, Java, and alike&mdash;**
If you are not familiar with embedded development there is good news. There is also a "server-side" for each of the technologies. Writing server-side code is typically done in Python, Java, and alike. 


### Hardware and Software
For work on end hosts we will make hardware available. This hardware will be based on Arm v8-M (for RATS), Arm v7-M (for SUIT), and Arm v7-A (for TEEP). Prior to the hackathon you will need to configure the development environment and we will provide setup guidelines, if you are not already familiar with embedded software development. The required hardware, software and development environment differs depending on whether you select TEEP, RATS, or SUIT. More details will follow.

## Potential Projects

Prior to the event we will share a couple of sample project ideas, in case you are new to the topic and do not yet already have an idea. If you select your own project, please stick to one of the three topics (or a mix of them). The scope is already wide enough so that you do not need to work on something that is unrelated to the RATS, SUIT, or TEEP. It is worth noting that these technologies can also be used [outside the IoT space](background).


## Registration

Participation at the hackathon is free but requires registration until January 17, 2020 via [https://siot-hackathon-2020.eventbrite.com/](https://siot-hackathon-2020.eventbrite.com/).
